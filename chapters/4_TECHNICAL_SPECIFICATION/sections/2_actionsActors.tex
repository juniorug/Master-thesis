\section{Actions And Actors}\label{sec:actionsAndActors}

A set of rules governs the system. These rules define how users interact with the system and how the data is shared among the users. Moreover, once the rules are stored in the blockchain, they can not be altered without broadcasting to all nodes and verified by most of them.
%%% SETUP

\subsection{Setup}\label{sec:Setup}
Setup is the set of actions to configure the application. The setup phase is when a new supply chain is created, or an existing one is updated or deleted. Users can also be created, updated, and deleted by setup actions. When creating or editing a supply chain, Admin users will define which steps, sub-steps, and information the supply chain flow will contain. Users from member groups can add info and move an asset to each step in the logistics network. Administrators are the only users in the Admin group. This actor type has access to all areas of the program. It has the same abilities like all other user types (configuring, moving the asset, and viewing flow). However, his primary responsibility is to configure the application and perform the setup actions.


%%% DATA INSERTION

\subsection{Data Insertion}\label{sec:DataInsertion}

Data insertion is the action that will fill the supply chain flow with data. Once the admin user creates a new supply chain, it is ready to be populated with information. Member and admin users are responsible for performing these actions. In the Data Insertion phase, users can update information from a specific step and sub-step and move assets depending on the rules applied in the setup phase. The most common actor types in SCM are Raw material/Producer, Manufacturer, Distributor Wholesaler, and Retailer.

%%% VISUALIZATION

\subsection{Visualization}\label{sec:Visualization}

Any user in the system can perform visualization actions. However, its main purpose is to provide the end-user the capability to track the flow of an asset from the point of origin to the point of consumption.
