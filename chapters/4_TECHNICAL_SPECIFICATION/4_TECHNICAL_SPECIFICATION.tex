\ac{SCM-BP} has the general objective to create a generic framework intended to be used in any kind of supply chain correlated to assets and products. 

An SCM platform relies on three main items: assets (the goods itself), steps (phases which products go through) and actors (people who transact assets during the steps). Our approach is based on this triad, that must be defined on the creation of a new supply chain. The workflow is divided in two phases: design time and execution time. Design time is when an administrator configure the asset flow: define asset info, steps, actors and create the relation between these entities. Execution time is composed by the actions of create, move and track an asset items through the supply chain. 

In the design time, initially, a configuration file in JSON format is generated and read in the Blockchain platform, adding the main information for the correct functioning of the chain. The mechanism for creating this configuration file is detailed in the Sections \Cref{sec:UserInteraction,sec:ServiceLayer}.
