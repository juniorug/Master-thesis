\section{Blockchain}\label{sec:blockchain}

Recently, cryptocurrency has attracted extensive attention from both the industry and the academy. Bitcoin, often called the first cryptocurrency, had massive success, with the capital market coming to \$ 10 billion in 2016 \cite{coindesk}. Blockchain is the central mechanism of Bitcoin and was first proposed in 2008 and implemented in 2009 \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. The blockchain can be considered a  public ledger, in which All committed transactions are stored in a block chain. This chain grows continuously when new blocks are attached to it \cite{zheng2016blockchain}.

At the origin of the blockchain is the Bitcoin protocol, proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. This article proposes a  \ac{P2P} network where transactions with the cryptocurrency bitcoin, proposed by customers, are received by servers, who will decide, through a consensus protocol based on cryptographic challenges, on the order in which they will be carried out and permanently stored in a chain of blocks, replicated on each server. According to \citeonline{FORMIGONI2017}, it was the creation of a digital currency that worked in a P2P network that allowed the sending of online payments in a completely secure way, without the involvement of financial institutions, for all participants from the web. In this sense, blockchain was created motivated by an efficient, economical, reliable, and secure system to conduct and record financial transactions. Hence the question: what is the relationship between blockchain and Bitcoin? Blockchain is the platform used for the operation of the Bitcoin network and several other cryptocurrencies.

While the system of financial institutions that serve as third parties reliable processors for processing payments work well for most still suffers from the shortcomings inherent in the model based on confidence. In addition, the cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical size of the transaction and eliminating the possibility of occasional small transactions. To solve these problems, \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} defined an electronic payment system called Bitcoin based on cryptographic proof rather than reliability, allowing either party to be willing to transact directly without the need for a reliable third party.

This revolution began with a new marginal economy on the Internet. Bitcoin emerges as an alternative currency issued and not backed by a central authority but by automated consensus among networked users. However, its true uniqueness lay in the fact that it did not require that users trust each other. Through self-policing algorithmically, any malicious attempt to circumvent the system would be rejected. In a precise and technical definition, Bitcoin is digital money transacted via the Internet in a decentralized system without bail, using a ledger called blockchain. It is a new way of combining peer-to-peer file sharing rent with public key encryption \cite{swan2015blockchain}.

For \cite{swan2015blockchain}, besides the currency ( "Blockchain 1.0"), smart contracts ("2.0") demonstrate how the blockchain is in a position to become the fifth disruptive computing paradigm after mainframes, PCs, Internet, and mobile/ social networks. Bitcoin is starting to become a digital currency, but the technology blockchain behind it can be much more significant.

The rapid growth in blockchain technology adoption and the development of applications based on this technology have revolutionized financial services industries. In addition to bitcoin, typical applications of blockchain usage vary from proprietary networks used to process financial claims, insurance claims to platforms that can issue and trade equity and corporate bonds \cite{michael2018blockchain}.

Blockchain exists with real-world implementations beyond cryptocurrencies, and these solutions deliver potent benefits to healthcare organizations, bankers, retailers, and consumers. The potential benefits of blockchain are more than just economic. They extend to the political, humanitarian, social, and scientific domains. Specific groups are already harnessing their technological capacity to solve real-world problems \cite{michael2018blockchain}.



\subsection{Blockchain Properties}\label{sec:propriedades}

Blockchain technology has key features such as centralization, persistence, anonymity, and auditability. Blockchain can function in a decentralized environment that is activated by integrating several key technologies such as cryptographic hash, digital signature (based on asymmetric encryption), and distributed consensus engine. With blockchain technology, a transaction may occur in a decentralized manner. As a result, blockchain can significantly save costs and improve efficiency \cite{zheng2016blockchain}. The primary properties of the blockchain are considered innovative and enable rapid adoption for technology \cite{greve2018blockchain}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Decentralization: Applications and systems run in a distributed manner, through the establishment of trust between the parties, without the need for a trusted intermediary entity. This is the primary motivator for the growing interest in the blockchain.
\item Availability and integrity: All datasets and transactions are securely replicated in different nodes to keep the system available and consistent.
\item Transparency and auditability: All transactions recorded in the ledger are public and can be verified and audited. Furthermore, technology codes are often open, verifiable.
\item Immutability and Irrefutability: Transactions recorded in the ledger are immutable. Once registered, they cannot be refuted. Updates are possible based on the generation of new transactions and the realization of a new consensus.
\item Privacy and Anonymity: It is possible to offer privacy to users without the third parties involved having access and control of their data. In technology, each user manages their keys, and each server node stores only encrypted fragments of user data. Transactions are somewhat anonymous, based on the address of those involved in the blockchain.
\item Disintermediation: Blockchain enables the integration between different systems directly and efficiently. Thus, it is considered a connector of complex systems (systems of systems), allowing the elimination of intermediaries to simplify the design of systems and processes.
\item Cooperation and Incentives: Offer of an incentive-based business model in the light of game theory. On-demand consensus is now offered as a service at different levels and scopes.
\end{itemize}
